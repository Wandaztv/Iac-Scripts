# Docker - Node.js App

This repository contains a Docker setup for a simple Node.js application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-node-app .
    ```

3. Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 my-node-app
    ```

4. You can also use Docker Compose to spin up the container along with other services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Dockerfile Explanation

- The `Dockerfile` sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs the app.
- The app listens on port 8080.

## Troubleshooting

- If you run into permission issues, ensure you have the right Docker user permissions or try running with `sudo`.
